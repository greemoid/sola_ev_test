# Sola EV Charging Stations App

This Flutter application displays a list of EV charging stations, allows users to view detailed information about each station, and mark stations as favorites. The favorite status is saved between app launches using `SharedPreferences`.

## Features
- **State Management:** Uses `BLoC` for predictable state handling.
- **Dependency Injection:** `GetIt` is used for managing dependencies.
- **Local Storage:** Favorites are stored using `SharedPreferences`.
- **Data Handling:** Data is loaded from a JSON file in the assets.
- **Smooth UI/UX:**
    - `Hero` animations enhance navigation transitions.
    - `cached_network_image` optimizes image loading.
- **Navigation:** Implemented with `auto_route`, supporting web navigation.
- **Testing:** Includes unit and widget tests using `mocktail`.
